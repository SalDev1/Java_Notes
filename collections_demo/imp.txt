What is Collection in Java ?

Collection  --> Interface 
Collections --> A Class

If you want a list of elements 
One way of doing it is using Array.

int a[] = new int[A];
Collection values = new ArrayList();

ArrayList is a class that implements a list of elements
directly.
Collection (Interface) --> List (Interface) --> ArrayList (Class).

values.add(5);
values.add(6);

It is helpful class to deal with problems including the list of elements. 
It is similar to the vector library in C++.


vector<int>arr = C++ Way 
Collection array = new ArrayList() --> Java Way.

Default type of ArrayList() will be ObjectType.

ObjectType --> you can add any kind or type of elements including nums , strings , chars
, etc.

If you want to store elements of specific type , then you can specific the type 
Collection<Integer> values = new ArrayList<Integer>();

Collection doesn't work with indices as the normal array does.
To work with indices we use list , which is child of Collection.

List<Integer> values = new ArrayList<>();

To store unique values of list , we use Set 
Hashset class has the interface Set.

Set<Integer> values = new HashSet<>();
Map<Integer,String> m = new HashMap<>();
