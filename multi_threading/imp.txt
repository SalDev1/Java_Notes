Multithreading 


In simple words , multithreading relates to 
performing multiple tasks at the same time.

Eg:- Understanding the concept of multithreading using real life example.
MS Word :- Main Process
Typing :- Sub Process
Spell Check :- Sub Process 

These sub processes are called as threads.

Thread --> Unit of a process. 
If you break the process into multiple units , each unit is said to be Thread.

Why do we need threads ?? 
1] Using Complete Power of CPU.
2] Async task in Android.

When you use Java Application , you only use one thread.
In every Java code or application , we have at least one java thread called main.

How to acheive Threads ?? 
Let's create an object of the Threads.

Thread d1 = new Thread();
Responsibility of d1 thread is to convert each element of array twice the original val.

So , to assign the work to d1 
create a class of the thread. 

Eg :- 

class MyThread extends Thread. 
{
    int[] values = {6,5,1,7,8}
    public void run() {
        for(int i = 0 ; i < 5 ; i++) {
            values[i] = values[i] * 2;
        }
    }
}

It is necessary for a class to be the  Thread , so use 
the extend keyword to achieve the true power of thread.

Then it will automatically call the run method using the 
start method.

Let's say we have a class A 

and my thread wants to extend with the class A , what is the way of doing it ??
