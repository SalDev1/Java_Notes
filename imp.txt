How Java Works ?? 

Suppose we want to create a software using calculator ??

We must first having the source file 

The Source File Code Must Be Converted into Byte Code 

Using the Complier , we are able to convert the source 
code into byte code 

We need a platform to run the byte code and as Java 
is platform independent , we required a platform to 
run the byte code. 

The platform / software is called the Java 
Virtual Machine.

Once we run the byte code on the JVM Machine , 
it creates an object and we are able to run the code. 


This is how Java Works. 

Variable in Java :- Just consider it as a container.
This container has the ability to store all kinds of data 
whether they are chars , strings , numbers , etc. 

And also have the ability to create different kinds of container
for different purposes. 

Common / Primitive Data Types 
char --> 2 Bytes 
byte --> 1 Bytes
short --> 2 Bytes 
int --> 4 Bytes 
float --> 4 Bytes 
long --> 4 Bytes 
double --> 8 Bytes 
boolean --> N/A 
String --> YOLO

When writing JAVA Code --> Declare Class , then main method. 

Java is a typesafe language

Naming Convention is important 
Eg :- sname , stockprice. --> variable names 
Class Names --> Strig , Integer , Student , Worker , Engineer 
Interface Name --> Runable , Serializable . (Should be adjective).

Class --> Noun --> Students , Person , Computer , Hashmap.
Method --> Verb 
Variable --> specific name of the feature that perfectly describes the situation (stockprice , bankdetails).
Constant --> PI , DENSITY , MAX_PRICE --> Fixed value to be assigned and being used. 

Java --> Follows Camel Casing Rule. 

Following them , makes you code more readable. 
 
Package is a keyword that gives access to the multiple classes
as these classes are been compressed into a one single folder and 
can be used anywhere using package.

Examples :- 
IO classes --> java.io classes. 
Networking classes --> java.net classes. 
JDBC classes -->  java.sql classes.

Eg :- www.google.com is only used by google , No one else can use it.
and uses package called com.package.

You must make sure that whatever package you create should always 
be unique to each other.

In order to make your package unique 
Package name should be mirror of Domain Name.

We can have packages inside the package  
com.Telusko.Test.*

It is always better to put different classes into different
packages.
